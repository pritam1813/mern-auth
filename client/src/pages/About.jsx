        A MERN stack authentication app typically uses the MERN stack, which
        stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. These technologies are
        used to build a full-stack web application with a focus on user
        authentication.{" "}

        In a MERN stack authentication app, the user enters their username and
        password into a login form. The data is then sent to the server via an
        HTTP request. The server checks the provided credentials against the
        data stored in the MongoDB database. If the credentials are valid, the
        server generates a session token and sends it back to the client. The
        client can then use this token to authenticate subsequent requests to
        protected routes.
